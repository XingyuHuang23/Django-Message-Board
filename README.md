# Django-Message-Board
A python Django Based information sharing and message board project

Really learn a lot form the Django study Process, so that's why Full stack would be ez today and more modelized. Django really give us a good full stack template.

But the question for Django, personally I thought it would be over templated so that it would a little hard to customize our own. Maybe we will get more and more middlewares to convenient the process, but that would be like WordPress? 

LOL, anyway Django is really amazing and shocked me alot, python full stack not bad for sure!
