# Django-Message-Board
A python Django Based information sharing and message board project

Really learn a lot form the Django study Process, so that's why Full stack would be ez today and more modelized. Django really give me a good full stack template.

But the question for Django, personally I thought it would be over templated so that it would a little hard to customize our own. Maybe we will get more and more middlewares to convenient the process, but that would be like WordPress? 

LOL, anyway Django is really amazing and shocked me alot, python full stack not bad for sure!


üèÉHow to run:
Just simply clone the repo in local, and make sure you have Python 3.8 up version Npm environment in your pc, and then go to root folder run "npm start", go to app folder, switch to your py env and run "python manage.py runserver", and then enjoy the chattttt!!
